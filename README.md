##  Project introduction:

Space: A space full of water
User: Biography
User operation mode: Mouse control movement


Interaction: Drop the cube from the top of the screen (representing the source of pollution). The first drop is a natural drop. From the second time, press the “a” key, and each drop increases by 20%. To form pollution, the user controls the obj model creature through the mouse to avoid pollution, and a rebound reaction will occur if it encounters pollution.


Data Transfer: Taking the example of change data of water pollution in Nanjing over the past 50 years .The more serious the water pollution situation (the bigger the data), the more the number of small balls dropped, and the smaller the data, the more the number of dropped balls.


Ideal effect: As the levels change, the data values change, causing different levels of difficulty.
